    <h2>Is smoking bad for your health?</h2>
    <p style="font-family:verdana">Since at least the 1950s, health experts have linked smoking to lung cancer. Research continues to pinpoint more
        ways tobacco harms your health, from cancers to chronic (long-term) diseases.
        Experts estimate that 16 million Americans live with a disease caused by smoking. Every year, roughly 480,000
        people die from smoking-related diseases. That means that for every person who dies from smoking, at least 30
        others live with a serious smoking-related illness.
